        <p>I am a Data Analyst proficient in Excel, Python, Tableau, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I have a degree in Philosophy which has taught me how to logically approach problems.  I enjoy translating data that a business collects into understandable visualization models to help them make better decisions for their future goals.

        <h2><a href="https://cross-gen-games.itch.io/"  target="_blank">Cross Gen Games</a></h2>
        <p>This is my small game development studio hobby.  All of these games were made in a week for weekly game jam  competitons.  The game jam organizers provided a theme and I had to  make a game in a week based on that theme. </p>

        <h2><a href="https://github.com/Roddy-Ackerman/capstone_excel_model"  target="_blank">Lariat Car Rentals Capstone Project</a></h2>
        <p>This is a simulated car rental company for my Thinkful Data Analytics course in which I had to analyze the data from 2018 of this fake car company and provide some strategies to make more money for 2019 using EXCEL.  The excel model shows the tables I created out of the data collected and also the models that allow for user input data manipulation and projection models.  </p>
