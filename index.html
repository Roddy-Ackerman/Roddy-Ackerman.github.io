        <p>I am a Data Analyst proficient in Excel, Python, Tableau, SQL, and PostgreSQL. I have a degree in Philosophy which has taught me how to logically approach problems.  I enjoy translating data that a business collects into understandable visualization models to help them make better decisions for their future goals.
